This is a Calculator which works on voice command build with python

Modules Used:-

1)	Tkinter:-
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.

2)	Math:-
The Python math module provides functions that are useful in number theory as well as in representation theory, a related field. These functions allow you to calculate a range of important values. These functions allow you to calculate a range of important values, including the following:
I)	The factorials of a number
II)	The greatest common divisor of two numbers
III)	The sum of iterables

3)	Parser:-
The parser module provides an interface
to Python's internal parser and byte-code compiler. The primary purpose for this interface is to allow Python code to edit

a Python application. These buttons can display text or images that convey the purpose of the buttons.
2)	root(): From this a root window is created.The root window is a main application window in our program as it has a title bar and borders .
